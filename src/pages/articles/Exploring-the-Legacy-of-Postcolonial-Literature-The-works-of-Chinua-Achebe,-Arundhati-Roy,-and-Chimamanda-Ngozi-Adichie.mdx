In Things Fall Apart, Achebe portrays the clash between the traditional Igbo culture of Nigeria and the encroaching British colonialism. The novel's protagonist, Okonkwo, is a proud and stoic man of the tribe, but is ultimately powerless against the ruthless colonial administration. His life is turned upside down and he is faced with the stark reality that his own culture is unable to protect him. He ultimately dies trying to fight against the British, a symbol of his people's determination despite their inability to overcome colonialism.

Arundhati Roy's work is renowned for its deep exploration of the themes of colonial oppression and its pervasive effects on the individuals and communities it touches. In novels like The God of Small Things and The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, Roy dives deep into the personal and emotional ramifications of life under the Indian Raj. Through vivid character portrayals and intricate plotlines, Roy paints a picture of a society defined by extreme economic inequality and political marginalization. She highlights how the colonization of India brought about an artificial homogenization that erased the cultural and social distinctions of its many diverse ethnic and religious communities.

In The God of Small Things, Roy uses twins Estha and Rahel as the main characters to explore the implications of colonial rule. She portrays the twins as unmoored from their familial cultural context and left adrift in an oppressive society that does not recognize their Indian identity. This effect is reinforced in the novel’s opening scene, which is set in the city of Ayemenem, where the twins were born. The city is described as a place defined by “its conspicuous silence,” which symbolizes the pervasive sense of oppression that characterizes Indian life under the Raj.
